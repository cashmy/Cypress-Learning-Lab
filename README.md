# Personal learning: Cypress Testing Integration

This repo is a cloned project used purely for the sake of personal traing in Cypress.
The original commits of the project are preserved to give credit for the appliation to the developers.
My commits are limited to the learning and execution of the Cypress package for testing integration.
